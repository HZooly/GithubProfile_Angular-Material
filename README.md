# GithubProfile_Angular-Material

Display any user informations in a clean single page interface built with Angular Material.

## Requirements

- Node

## Installation

`$ git clone`

`$ npm install`

## Note

I developed this interface without asking Github Authentification. HTTP calls are limited per IP. To avoid this, you can use a dynamic IP or wait the refresh rate.
